Many Mojo changes expected. Please, a quick (dirty is OK) PR or issue if you see anything out of date.

### Is it OK to share code from the Mojo Playground?
> Brian Gesiak [Modular]: Absolutely — it’s fine to share Mojo code, as you own copyright to your work. In fact I think a lot of us would love to see it, feel free to post a link in this Discord to share!

### Is Mojo compiled AOT or JIT?
> Chris Lattner [Modular]: We're working hard to get Mojo built out and available to more people and in more ways, so we haven't documented everything like this (stay tuned for more over time of course).  The short answer is that the 'mojo' command line tool includes a bunch of things (including AOT compilation) but defaults to "run this like a script" mode using a JIT.

### Does Mojo have a language server?
> Chris Lattner [Modular]: Works great in VSCode and has nice LSP support.  We aren't exposing that quite yet, but will as things settle down a bit

### Will Mojo follow Python, or will there be sugary-sweet changes?
> Chris Lattner [Modular]: Syntactic sugar is fun and can be exciting, but it is also dangerous, and I'd personally prefer we avoid it completely unless it is extremely highly motivated by the core use case (accelerators, systems programming etc) that Python doesn't already service
>There are a gagillion (technical term there) theoretical features we could add to Python to make it better in various ways, but we're resisting the urge.  We want Mojo to be a good member of the Python community, and the systems programming features and compatibility features need a lot continued development.
